My HTML notes
</h1>


<p>
  <strong>HYPERTEXT:</strong> A form of text in which documents can refer (link) to other documents and resources.
</p>
<p>
  HTML is the main language that we use to write <strong>web pages</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>HTML:</strong> HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE.<br>
  <strong>HTTP:</strong> HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCAL<em> "used for communication with server"</em>. <br>
  <strong>HTTPS:</strong> HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCAL SECURE
</p>
<p>
  A web browser is an application, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari, that is designed for displaying web pages.
</p>
  1.Web pages are usually stored on servers.<br>
  2.Usually, to load a web page, your browser sends a request for that page to a server.<br>
  3.When you type udacity.com into your browser, your browser communicates with Udacity's server using HTTP (or HTTPS).<br>
  4.Udacity's web server returns an HTML file to your browser.<br>
  5.Based on information contained in the HTML, your browser requests other files from Udacity's web server and from other web servers.<br>
  6.When you go to a page on the Web, your browser sends a request to a server.<br>
  7.A web page can include resources (like videos or images) from multiple web servers.<br>
  8.The Mozilla Developer Network is a major resource for web developers.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"> mozilla developer network

<p>
em stands for emphasis
</p>
<p>
  <em>MARKUP</em> is just a text with a special meaning.
</p>
<p> Here is an example which is looks same in a web browser but looks different in ATOM.
</p>
<p>
  Did you know? Spaces, tabs, and line breaks are called
<strong>whitespace</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Did you
know?
    Spaces,
    tabs,
and line
breaks     are     called
     <strong>whitespace</strong>.
</p>
<P>
  This happen because of <strong>whitespace</strong> collapse when you open the HTML in a browser.<br>
   <p>Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks.<br> When the browser displays an HTML file, it treats a run of whitespace as a single space character.
   </p>
   We can use double br tags to make space like p tag does<br><br>Here we got space
   <p>
     The grammar rules of a language is syntax.<br>
     <mark>Nesting</mark> is the idea that some bits of code can go inside other bits of code.<br>
     Code that tells the browser what the text on a web page should look like Markuo.<br>
     <p>
      Tag <sub>br</sub> is known as <sup>void</sup> tags.
     </p>
<p>
  sub and sup stand for "subscript" and "superscript".<br>
  Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work;<br>
  and these are really useful for science and math, like writing <strong>x2+3x+4 = 1</strong> or chemical formulas like<strong>  H2O.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  HTML element can't overlap and one must be inside the other.<br>
  Here is an example for <strong><mark><em>Nesting</em></mark></strong>.
</p>
<p>
  These are some <mark>important equations: <em>e=mc<sup>2</sup></em></mark>
</p>
<p>
  HTML has several elements for headlines or section headings, starting with h1 tag for the largest headlines and going down to h6 tag for the smallest.
  </p>

<p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
<h3>The Web
</h3>
<p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>
<h3>What is HTML?
</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>

<h2>Element Practice</h2>
<h3>My chemistry notes</h3>
<p><strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em></p>
<p><strong>Molecular formula:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density than air. Basically the opposite of helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark></p>

<p>Call me Ishmael.</p>
<p>Just don't call me late for dinner.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Lists and implied close tags</strong></p>
<h2>How to compose a music</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Download or buy a DAW.
    <ul>
      <li>FL Studio, or</li>
      <li>Logic pro X, or</li>
      <li>Abelton live</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Connect your MIDI controller to your home studio.</li>
    <li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The p element is another example of an element for which the closing tag is optional.<br>
  Remember, when you leave off an optional closing tag, it is still implied—that is,<br>
  the browser will figure out where the element should be closed, even though you didn't explicitly tell it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>.Remember, the closing tag on the li element is optional.<br>
So you can include them or leave them off and it will work the same either way.</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learn HTML.
  <li>Learn CSS.
  <li>Learn Python.
  <li>Save the world.
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Mammals
    <ol>
      <li>Raccoons
      <li>Gorillas
    </ol>
  <li>Reptiles
    <ol>
      <li>Iguanas
      <li>Cobras
    </ol>
  <li>Birds

      <li>Ravens
    </ol>
</ul>


  URL - Uniform Resource Locator.<br>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Uniform = </strong>Standardized
    <li><strong>Resource = </strong>a file or other data object
    <li><strong>Locator = </strong>address for finding something
  </ul>



  <ul>
  <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/<br>
  <li>file:///C:/Users/Sudhanshu%20Kumar/Desktop/UDACITY/notes/notes.html<br>
  <li>Here http, https, file is Protocal. and protocal is separated by ://(colon and double slash). And then domain name comes. And then file path i.e., / (single slash)<br>
  <li>When you're linking to the top page (or home page) of a site, the URL does not need a file path after the domain name.<br><br>
  <li>Lets talk about fully qualified URL.<br>
  <li>https://www.simons-rock.edu is a fully qualified URL that takes you to the main page of a web site.<br>
  <li>And file:///home/kelly/photos/Scotland1.jpg is a perfectly fine file URL for referring to a file on your own computer ... <br>
  if you happen to be Kelly on a Linux computer. But keep in mind, if you give a file:// URL to someone else, they probably can't access it because they don't have that file in the exact same location.
</ul>

    </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    href is hypertext reference.<br>
    a is called an anchor element.<br>
    The a element is an inline element. It doesn't create a box on the page.<br>
    Links normally have the appearance of a specially highlighted piece of text.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Adding Image
      </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>src = URL of the image (source)
    <li>alt = text description of the image
    </ul>
    Img file is a void element same as br.<br>
    src and alt are attribute of the HTML. and Img is an inline element.


  <img src="https://i.redd.it/g2lyzew73gzy.png" alt="Iron man vs Captain">

  <p>
    In HTML, a URL with no :// in it is always treated as relative URL.<br>
    A file:// URL is not a relative URL. It specifies the full location of a file on the local computer's filesystem.
    </p>
<p>
  <img src="stormbreaker.PNG" alt="stormbreaker"><br>
  When you put an img in your HTML which is situated in your system then always put the img in the same folder where you saved your HTML file.<br>
  This is known as relative URL.
  </p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Attributes always go inside the start tag of an HTML element.</strong></em><br>
  div — A logical division of a page or document.<br>
  Other block elements such as paragraphs, lists, and headers can be nested inside a div.
  img — Images.<br>
  a — Hyperlinks.Needs an href attribute with a URL.
</p>
<p>
  the list items in this design are also hyperlinks! And if you click on one of them, it will open in a new browser tab.<br>

  These are required for a full HTML document.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A DOCTYPE tags.
    <li>A title element with an open and close tag.
    </ul>
